# ADR-001: Detection Engine Architecture

**Status**: Accepted  
**Deciders**: Team  
**Date**: 2025-06-18  
**Technical Story**: Core architecture for agent state detection in Cursor IDE monitoring system  

## Context and Problem Statement

The Agent Monitor POC requires a robust and extensible detection engine to identify different states of the Cursor IDE agent (idle, active, unknown). The system needs to accurately detect UI button states while providing flexibility for multiple detection strategies and fallback mechanisms.

The primary challenge is to create a detection system that:
- Provides high confidence state detection
- Supports multiple detection methods (template matching, OCR, potential future vision models)
- Maintains good performance for real-time monitoring
- Allows for easy extension and modification of detection strategies

## Decision Drivers

- **Performance requirements**: Real-time detection with 2-second intervals
- **Accuracy concerns**: High confidence detection to minimize false positives
- **Maintainability**: Easy to add new detection methods and modify existing ones
- **Team expertise**: Strong OpenCV and Python experience
- **Future extensibility**: Support for additional detection strategies (vision models, ML)
- **Debugging capability**: Need for diagnostic and confidence reporting

## Considered Options

1. **Strategy Pattern with Multiple Detectors** - Modular design with pluggable detection strategies
2. **Single Template Matching Engine** - Simple OpenCV-based template matching only
3. **ML-First Approach** - Machine learning model for state detection
4. **Hybrid Fixed Pipeline** - Hardcoded sequence of detection methods

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen option**: "Strategy Pattern with Multiple Detectors"

**Rationale**: This approach provides the best balance of flexibility, maintainability, and performance. It allows us to implement template matching as the primary detection method while supporting OCR fallback and future vision models. The Strategy pattern enables easy testing, debugging, and extension of detection capabilities.

### Positive Consequences
- Modular and testable architecture
- Easy to add new detection strategies
- Clear separation of concerns between detection methods
- Support for confidence scoring and diagnostics
- Fallback capabilities for improved reliability

### Negative Consequences
- Slightly more complex initial implementation
- Requires proper dependency injection setup
- Multiple detection strategies may have different performance characteristics

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Strategy Pattern with Multiple Detectors

**Description**: Implement a Protocol-based interface with multiple detector implementations, managed through dependency injection

**Pros**:
- High flexibility and extensibility
- Clean separation of detection logic
- Easy to test individual detection strategies
- Support for confidence scoring and diagnostics
- Enables fallback mechanisms
- Future-proof for ML/vision integration

**Cons**:
- More complex initial architecture
- Requires proper dependency management
- Potential performance overhead from multiple strategies

### Single Template Matching Engine

**Description**: Simple implementation using only OpenCV template matching

**Pros**:
- Simple and straightforward implementation
- High performance for template matching
- Proven reliability for UI element detection
- Easy to debug and tune

**Cons**:
- Limited to template matching only
- No fallback for template failures
- Difficult to extend for new detection methods
- Single point of failure

### ML-First Approach

**Description**: Use machine learning models (CLIP, vision transformers) for state detection

**Pros**:
- Potentially higher accuracy for complex scenarios
- Could handle UI changes automatically
- More robust to visual variations

**Cons**:
- Requires significant ML expertise
- Higher computational requirements
- Need for training data collection
- Less deterministic results

## Implementation Details

### Technical Approach

The implementation uses a Protocol-based interface `StateDetector` with concrete implementations:

1. **TemplateMatchDetector**: Primary detection using OpenCV template matching
   - Dual template approach (idle and generating states)
   - Confidence scoring with configurable thresholds
   - Match rectangle tracking for debugging
   
2. **OCRDetector**: Fallback detection using pytesseract
   - Text-based state detection
   - Configurable via OCR_ENABLED flag

3. **AgentMonitor**: Orchestration layer managing multiple detectors
   - Strategy pattern implementation
   - Result aggregation and confidence scoring
   - Diagnostic mode support

### Migration Strategy

The system is implemented from scratch with the strategy pattern as the foundation. No migration is required.

### Timeline

- **Phase 1** (Completed): Core strategy pattern implementation
- **Phase 2** (Completed): Template matching detector with confidence scoring
- **Phase 3** (Completed): OCR fallback detector integration
- **Phase 4** (Future): Vision model integration capability

## Validation

### Success Criteria
- Detection accuracy > 95% for template matching
- Response time < 500ms per detection cycle
- Support for at least 2 detection strategies
- Confidence scoring for all detection methods
- Diagnostic mode for debugging and tuning

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for individual detector implementations
- Integration tests for multi-detector scenarios
- Performance benchmarks for detection timing
- Accuracy validation against known UI states

### Monitoring
- Detection confidence scores logged via telemetry
- Success/failure rates tracked per detector type
- Performance metrics for detection timing
- False positive/negative rate monitoring

## Notes

The Strategy pattern implementation provides excellent flexibility for future enhancements, including potential integration with vision models (CLIP, EasyOCR) and machine learning approaches. The current template matching approach achieves confidence scores of 0.75-0.88 in practice, providing reliable detection for the Cursor IDE interface.
