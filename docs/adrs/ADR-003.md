# ADR-003: UI Framework Choice

**Status**: Accepted  
**Deciders**: Team  
**Date**: 2025-06-18  
**Technical Story**: Native macOS user interface framework for agent monitoring control panel  

## Context and Problem Statement

The Agent Monitor POC requires a user interface for controlling the monitoring system, displaying real-time status, and providing access to statistics and debugging information. The UI needs to integrate seamlessly with the macOS desktop environment while providing professional appearance and responsive performance.

Key requirements include:
- Native macOS look and feel
- Floating window capability for overlay usage
- Real-time status updates and controls
- Minimal resource footprint
- Professional appearance with modern styling
- Integration with macOS notification system
- Support for transparency and window management

## Decision Drivers

- **Native integration**: Must feel like a native macOS application
- **Performance requirements**: Minimal resource usage for background operation
- **Development efficiency**: Leverage existing Python expertise
- **Platform targeting**: macOS-only application (no cross-platform needs)
- **Feature requirements**: Floating windows, transparency, native controls
- **Professional appearance**: Modern UI with proper styling and animations
- **System integration**: Menu bar, notifications, window management

## Considered Options

1. **PyObjC with AppKit** - Native macOS UI framework using Objective-C bridge
2. **Tkinter** - Cross-platform Python GUI toolkit
3. **PyQt/PySide** - Cross-platform Qt-based GUI framework
4. **Web-based UI (Electron-style)** - HTML/CSS/JS interface in Python web framework

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen option**: "PyObjC with AppKit"

**Rationale**: PyObjC provides direct access to native macOS UI components, ensuring perfect integration with the operating system. It enables advanced features like floating windows, transparency effects, and proper window management that are essential for an overlay monitoring tool.

### Positive Consequences
- Perfect native macOS integration and appearance
- Access to full AppKit feature set (transparency, floating windows, animations)
- Excellent performance with minimal resource usage
- Professional appearance that matches system UI conventions
- Integration with macOS services (notifications, menu bar, window management)
- Future-proof with macOS UI evolution

### Negative Consequences
- macOS-only compatibility (not cross-platform)
- Steeper learning curve for Objective-C concepts
- More complex debugging compared to pure Python UI frameworks
- Requires understanding of Objective-C method naming conventions

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### PyObjC with AppKit

**Description**: Direct bridge to macOS AppKit framework, providing native UI components and system integration

**Pros**:
- 100% native macOS appearance and behavior
- Full access to AppKit features (NSWindow, NSButton, Auto Layout)
- Excellent performance and resource efficiency
- Perfect system integration (notifications, menu bar, window styles)
- Support for advanced features (transparency, floating windows, animations)
- Automatic dark mode and accessibility support
- Professional appearance matching system conventions

**Cons**:
- macOS-only compatibility
- Complex method naming conventions (Objective-C bridge)
- Requires learning AppKit concepts and patterns
- More verbose code compared to simpler frameworks
- Debugging can be challenging with Objective-C bridge

### Tkinter

**Description**: Built-in Python GUI toolkit with cross-platform support

**Pros**:
- Built into Python (no additional dependencies)
- Simple and straightforward API
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Easy to learn and debug

**Cons**:
- Non-native appearance on macOS
- Limited styling and customization options
- No advanced window management features
- Poor integration with macOS system features
- Dated appearance and limited modern UI capabilities

### PyQt/PySide

**Description**: Python bindings for the Qt framework with extensive UI capabilities

**Pros**:
- Rich feature set and modern UI capabilities
- Good styling and customization options
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Mature ecosystem and documentation

**Cons**:
- Large dependency footprint
- Non-native appearance on macOS
- Complex licensing considerations (PyQt)
- Overkill for simple monitoring interface
- Less integration with macOS-specific features

## Implementation Details

### Technical Approach

The implementation leverages PyObjC to create a native macOS application:

1. **Main Application Structure**:
   - NSApplication setup with proper activation policy
   - Native window management with floating window levels
   - Integration with macOS menu system

2. **Control Panel** (`ControlPanel` class):
   - NSWindow with modern styling and transparency
   - Auto Layout for responsive design
   - Real-time status updates via NSTimer
   - Native button controls with proper styling

3. **Window Management**:
   - Floating window level for overlay usage
   - Transparency and backdrop effects
   - Proper window positioning and sizing
   - Movable window background

4. **UI Components**:
   - Styled NSButton controls with emoji indicators
   - NSTextField labels with proper typography
   - NSSlider for transparency control
   - Statistics and debug popup windows

### Key Implementation Patterns

```python
# Objective-C method naming convention
def createStyledButtonWithFrame_title_(self, frame, title):
    # Every colon (:) becomes underscore (_)
    # Method must end with underscore
    pass

# Auto Layout constraints
NSLayoutConstraint.activateConstraints_([
    button.topAnchor().constraintEqualToAnchor_constant_(view.topAnchor(), 10),
    button.leadingAnchor().constraintEqualToAnchor_constant_(view.leadingAnchor(), 10),
])

# Window styling with transparency
self.window.setBackgroundColor_(
    AppKit.NSColor.colorWithCalibratedRed_green_blue_alpha_(0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.95)
)
```

### Migration Strategy

Built from scratch with PyObjC as the foundation. No migration required.

### Timeline

- **Phase 1** (Completed): Basic NSWindow and control setup
- **Phase 2** (Completed): Auto Layout implementation and styling
- **Phase 3** (Completed): Real-time updates and window management
- **Phase 4** (Completed): Statistics and debug windows

## Validation

### Success Criteria
- Native macOS appearance and behavior
- Smooth real-time updates (1-second intervals)
- Proper window management and transparency
- Professional styling matching system conventions
- Resource usage < 50MB RAM for UI components

### Testing Strategy
- Visual regression testing for UI appearance
- Performance monitoring for update cycles
- Window management behavior validation
- Cross-version macOS compatibility testing
- Memory usage profiling

### Monitoring
- UI update performance metrics
- Memory usage tracking
- Window management behavior
- User interaction responsiveness

## Notes

The PyObjC implementation has proven highly successful for creating a professional macOS monitoring interface. The native integration provides excellent user experience with features like transparency, floating windows, and proper system integration. The main challenge was learning Objective-C method naming conventions, but this is well-documented in the gotchas guide. The resulting UI feels completely native and integrates seamlessly with the macOS desktop environment.
