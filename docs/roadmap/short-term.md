# Short-term Roadmap (Q1 2025)

## Overview

This document outlines the immediate priorities for the next 3 months, focusing on addressing current limitations and implementing the most critical features for intelligent agent automation.

## Priority 1: Enhanced State Detection üîç

### Expanded State Recognition
**Target**: Complete by end of January 2025

#### New States to Detect
- **Command Approval State**: When agent asks permission to run commands
  - Template: Modal dialog with "Run" and "Cancel" buttons
  - OCR backup: Text patterns like "Execute command?" or "Run the following?"
  - Priority: **High** - Critical for automation loop

- **Waiting for User Input**: Agent pausing for user response
  - Template: Input field with cursor or "Type your response" indicators
  - OCR backup: Prompts like "Please provide..." or "What would you like..."
  - Priority: **High** - Prevents infinite waiting

- **Error/Failed Command State**: When commands fail or produce errors
  - Template: Error icons, red indicators, or failure messages
  - OCR backup: Error text patterns like "Failed", "Error", "Command not found"
  - Priority: **Medium** - Important for error handling

- **Tool Selection State**: Agent choosing between different tools
  - Template: Tool selection dropdown or modal
  - OCR backup: Text like "Select tool" or "Choose option"
  - Priority: **Medium** - Useful for workflow optimization

#### Implementation Plan
1. **Week 1**: Create template capture utility for new states
2. **Week 2**: Implement template matching for new states
3. **Week 3**: Add OCR backup detection for each state
4. **Week 4**: Testing and confidence threshold tuning
