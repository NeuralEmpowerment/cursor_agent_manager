# Agent Automation Roadmap

## Vision

Transform the Cursor Agent Monitor from a passive state detection tool into an intelligent automation system that actively assists users by making smart decisions and reducing manual intervention in AI agent workflows.

## Core Value Proposition

**Problem**: Users constantly need to manually approve agent commands, respond to prompts, and manage agent interactions, breaking their flow and reducing productivity.

**Solution**: Intelligent automation that learns user patterns, safely handles routine decisions, and only interrupts for truly important choices.

## Automation Capabilities Framework

### Level 1: Basic Automation (Q1 2025)
**Goal**: Eliminate simple, repetitive manual tasks

#### Safe Command Auto-approval
- **File Operations**: Read, copy, move files within project scope
- **Code Operations**: Format, lint, compile, run tests
- **Package Management**: Install from whitelisted sources (npm, pip, etc.)
- **Git Operations**: Status, diff, add, commit with safe patterns
- **Documentation**: Generate, update docs and comments

#### Simple Response Automation
- **Confirmation Dialogs**: Auto-approve low-risk operations
- **Default Selections**: Choose reasonable defaults for routine choices
- **Retry Logic**: Automatically retry failed operations with common fixes

### Level 2: Context-Aware Automation (Q2-Q3 2025)
**Goal**: Make intelligent decisions based on project context and user patterns

#### Project Context Analysis
- **Project Type Detection**: Web app, library, CLI tool, etc.
- **Technology Stack Recognition**: React, Python, Node.js, etc.
- **Dependency Analysis**: Understand project structure and relationships
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate command safety based on project context

#### User Pattern Learning
- **Command Preference Tracking**: Learn which commands user approves/rejects
- **Workflow Pattern Recognition**: Identify common sequences of operations
- **Time-based Behavior**: Different automation levels for different times/contexts
- **Project-specific Rules**: Custom automation per project type

### Level 3: Intelligent Assistance (Q4 2025+)
**Goal**: Proactive assistance and predictive automation

#### Predictive Actions
- **Workflow Anticipation**: Prepare next steps based on current activity
- **Problem Prevention**: Identify and prevent common issues before they occur
- **Resource Management**: Optimize system resources and dependencies
- **Quality Assurance**: Automated checks for code quality and standards

#### Advanced Decision Making
- **Multi-factor Analysis**: Consider multiple inputs for complex decisions
- **Risk-benefit Calculation**: Weigh automation risks against productivity gains
- **Learning from Outcomes**: Improve decisions based on results
- **User Intent Prediction**: Understand user goals and optimize accordingly

## Automation Rules Engine

### Configuration System
```yaml
automation:
  level: "context-aware"  # basic, context-aware, intelligent
  
  commands:
    whitelist:
      - pattern: "npm install [package]"
        conditions: ["package in known_packages", "project has package.json"]
      - pattern: "git commit -m *"
        conditions: ["changes staged", "message length > 10"]
    
    blacklist:
      - pattern: "rm -rf *"
      - pattern: "sudo *"
      - pattern: "* --force"
    
    contextual:
      - if: "project_type == 'web_app'"
        allow: ["npm run build", "npm run test"]
      - if: "time_of_day == 'late_night'"
        require_confirmation: true
  
  responses:
    auto_confirm: ["low_risk_operations", "reversible_actions"]
    auto_reject: ["dangerous_operations", "irreversible_destructive"]
    
  learning:
    enabled: true
    adaptation_rate: 0.1
    confidence_threshold: 0.8
```

### Safety Framework

#### Multi-layer Safety System
1. **Static Analysis**: Parse commands for known dangerous patterns
2. **Context Validation**: Ensure commands make sense in current context
3. **User Pattern Matching**: Only automate actions user has approved before
4. **Reversibility Check**: Prefer actions that can be easily undone
5. **Scope Limitation**: Restrict automation to project boundaries

#### Safety Categories
- **Green Zone**: Always safe to automate (read operations, formatting)
- **Yellow Zone**: Safe with context validation (installs, builds)
- **Red Zone**: Never automate without explicit permission (deletions, system changes)

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Q1 2025)
```python
class AutomationEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.rules = AutomationRules()
        self.context = ProjectContext()
        self.safety = SafetyValidator()
    
    def evaluate_command(self, command_text: str) -> AutomationDecision:
        # Parse command
        command = self.parse_command(command_text)
        
        # Safety check
        safety_level = self.safety.evaluate(command)
        if safety_level == SafetyLevel.RED:
            return AutomationDecision.REQUIRE_APPROVAL
        
        # Rule matching
        if self.rules.matches_whitelist(command):
            return AutomationDecision.AUTO_APPROVE
        
        # Context analysis
        if self.context.is_safe_for_project(command):
            return AutomationDecision.AUTO_APPROVE
        
        return AutomationDecision.REQUIRE_APPROVAL
```

### Phase 2: Learning (Q2-Q3 2025)
```python
class LearningAutomation:
    def learn_from_decision(self, command: str, user_decision: bool, context: dict):
        # Update user preference model
        self.user_model.update(command, user_decision, context)
        
        # Adjust automation confidence
        pattern = self.extract_pattern(command)
        if user_decision:
            self.increase_confidence(pattern, context)
        else:
            self.decrease_confidence(pattern, context)
    
    def predict_approval(self, command: str, context: dict) -> float:
        # ML model prediction
        return self.model.predict_approval_probability(command, context)
```

### Phase 3: Intelligence (Q4 2025+)
```python
class IntelligentAutomation:
    def proactive_assistance(self, current_state: AgentState):
        # Analyze current workflow
        workflow = self.workflow_analyzer.current_workflow()
        
        # Predict next steps
        next_steps = self.predictor.predict_next_actions(workflow)
        
        # Prepare automation
        for step in next_steps:
            if self.can_automate(step):
                self.prepare_automation(step)
