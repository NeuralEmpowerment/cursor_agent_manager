- **Tool Selection State**: Agent choosing between different tools
- **Code Generation Complete**: When agent finishes generating code

#### Advanced Diagnostic Dashboard
**Goal**: Provide complete visibility into detection accuracy and system performance

- **Real-time Detection View**: Live view with confidence scores and detection overlays
- **Last Image Preview**: Show captured screenshots with template match visualization
- **Detection Heatmaps**: Color-coded confidence visualization across screen regions
- **Confidence Graphs**: Real-time charts showing detection confidence over time
- **State Timeline**: Visual timeline of state changes with timestamps
- **Detection Statistics**: Accuracy rates, false positive/negative tracking
- **Screenshot Archive**: Browse recent detection screenshots for troubleshooting
- **Interactive Threshold Tuner**: Visual tool for adjusting detection parameters

#### OCR Text Reading Engine
- **EasyOCR integration**: More accurate text recognition than Tesseract

```python
# Developer Dashboard Integration
class DeveloperDashboard:
    def __init__(self):
        self.monitor_controller = MonitorController()
        self.tool_launcher = ToolLauncher()
    
    def create_workflow_guidance(self):
        return {
            "improve_detection": "Use Template Capture tool",
            "check_performance": "Use Analytics CLI", 
            "debug_issues": "Use Detection Testing tools",
            "tune_accuracy": "Use Confidence Threshold Tuner"
        }
    
    def launch_template_capture(self):
        return self.tool_launcher.run_script("capture_template.py")
    
    def open_analytics_dashboard(self):
        return self.tool_launcher.run_analytics_cli("--dashboard")
```

### Phase 2: Intelligent Automation (Q2-Q3 2025)

#### Core Automation Engine
**Goal**: Safely automate routine decisions while learning user patterns

- **Safe Command Auto-approval**: Whitelist-based automation for low-risk operations
  - File operations (read, copy, move within project scope)
  - Code formatting, linting, and compilation
  - Package installations from trusted sources
  - Git operations (status, diff, commit with safe patterns)

- **Dangerous Command Protection**: Blacklist-based blocking of high-risk operations
  - System modifications (sudo, rm -rf)
  - Network operations to unknown hosts
  - File deletions outside project boundaries

- **Context-Aware Decision Making**: 
  - Project type detection (web app, library, CLI tool)
  - Technology stack recognition (React, Python, Node.js)
  - Risk assessment based on project context and command history

#### Machine Learning Integration
- **User Pattern Learning**: ML models to predict user approval patterns
- **Command Classification**: Automatic categorization of command safety levels
- **Workflow Pattern Detection**: Identify and optimize common user workflows
- **Anomaly Detection**: Flag unusual patterns that might indicate problems

#### SOLID Architecture Refactoring
**Goal**: Improve maintainability, readability, reliability, and extensibility

- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each class has one clear purpose
- **Open/Closed Principle**: Easy to extend without modifying existing code
- **Liskov Substitution**: Proper inheritance and interface contracts
- **Interface Segregation**: Small, focused interfaces
- **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions

```python
# Example: Clean Architecture Implementation
class DetectionService:
    def __init__(self, detector: StateDetector, telemetry: TelemetryService):
        self._detector = detector
        self._telemetry = telemetry
    
    def detect_current_state(self) -> DetectionResult:
        result = self._detector.detect_state()
        self._telemetry.log_detection(result)
        return result

class AutomationService:
    def __init__(self, rules: AutomationRules, safety: SafetyValidator):
        self._rules = rules
        self._safety = safety
    
    def should_automate(self, command: Command) -> AutomationDecision:
        if not self._safety.is_safe(command):
            return AutomationDecision.REQUIRE_APPROVAL
        return self._rules.evaluate(command)
```
