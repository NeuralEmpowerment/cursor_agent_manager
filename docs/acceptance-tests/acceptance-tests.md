## Test 4: Active State Detection

**User Story**: As a user, I want to know when the AI agent is actively processing so I don't interrupt it.

**Requirements**:
- The app should detect when Cursor's AI agent is generating/active
- The app should show "üöÄ active" status in the control panel
- The app should detect state changes within 1 second
- The app should stop any repeating idle alerts when becoming active
- The app should track how long each session lasts

## Test 5: Sound Alert Management

**User Story**: As a user, I want to receive audio notifications for state changes but also be able to mute them.

**Requirements**:
- The app should play a simple two-note sound for idle states
- The app should have distinct sounds for different alert types
- The app should have a mute/unmute button that works immediately
- The app should remember the mute setting between sessions
- The app should respect the system volume settings
- The app should not play overlapping sounds
- The app should respect mute settings for repeating alerts

## Test 6: Visual Status Indicators

**User Story**: As a user, I want clear visual indicators to see the current state at a glance.

- The app should show emoji status indicators (üí§, üöÄ, ‚ùì)
- The app should update the status within 100ms of detection
- The app should use consistent and intuitive symbols
- The app should keep the control panel always visible
- The app should handle window positioning properly
- The app should show confidence scores alongside state indicators

## Test 7: Control Panel Operations

**User Story**: As a user, I want an intuitive control panel to manage the monitor.

**Requirements**:
- The app should have responsive buttons (pause, mute, debug)
- The app should provide visual feedback for button clicks
- The app should maintain button states correctly (pressed/unpressed)
- The app should allow pausing and resuming monitoring
- The app should show a debug view when requested

## Test 8: Data Recording

**User Story**: As a user, I want all monitor activity recorded for later analysis.

**Requirements**:
- The app should save all detection events to a database
- The app should record timestamps, confidence scores, and coordinates
- The app should not lose data during normal operation
- The app should handle database errors gracefully
- The app should maintain data integrity across sessions

## Test 9: Analytics CLI

**User Story**: As a user, I want to analyze monitor performance through a command-line interface.

**Requirements**:
- The app should provide a `./run_analytics.sh` command
- The app should show basic statistics when requested
- The app should generate charts and visualizations
- The app should export data to CSV format
- The app should complete analytics operations within 10 seconds

## Test 10: Template Image Configuration

**User Story**: As a user, I want to customize template images for different UI themes.

**Requirements**:
- The app should load template images from `assets/ui-cursor/`
- The app should handle missing template files gracefully
- The app should use new templates when files are replaced
- The app should validate template image formats
- The app should provide clear error messages for invalid templates

## Test 11: Performance Under Load

**User Story**: As a user, I want the monitor to perform efficiently during extended use.

**Requirements**:
- The app should maintain consistent performance for hours of use
- The app should keep memory usage below 100MB
- The app should respond to UI interactions within 200ms
- The app should not slow down over time
- The app should handle rapid state changes correctly

## Test 12: Error Recovery

**User Story**: As a user, I want the system to recover gracefully from errors.

**Requirements**:
- The app should log errors with sufficient detail
- The app should continue monitoring after recoverable errors
- The app should show error status in the control panel
- The app should not crash on common errors
- The app should provide meaningful error messages

## Test 13: OCR Fallback

**User Story**: As a user, I want the system to use OCR when template matching fails.

**Requirements**:
- The app should automatically try OCR when templates fail
- The app should complete OCR analysis within 3 seconds
- The app should achieve >70% accuracy with OCR
- The app should record which detection method was used
- The app should handle OCR failures without crashing
